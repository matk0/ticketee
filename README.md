#Introduction
This is a sample Rails app which I use to showcase my coding skills. You can find it running at: https://peaceful-thicket-76794.herokuapp.com (please allow a few seconds for the app to wake up, it's running on heroku's free tier). To explore all of the functionality please login as: 'admin@ticketee.com' with password: 'password'. The app is fully tested using RSpec.
